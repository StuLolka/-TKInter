This is a university ranking work. Rating work - independent written work, requiring the student to apply skills acquired during the study of the discipline «High-level programming methods» knowledge and skills in solving practical problems in high-level programming language using standard algorithmic constructs. The tasks are oriented towards developing skills of programming in Python, logical and analytical thinking.

##Task
Write a program in the Python programming language, which should provide the following features:
1. The title in the main window changes from your last name to your ID and back.
2. When you load the program, the main window shows a triangle whose coordinates x are the last six digits of your ID, which is three double digits, and whose coordinates y are the last six digits of your ID divided by 3, which is three double digits. The shape of the triangle should be filled with solid paint.
3. The triangle coordinates can be changed in the main window by entering numbers into text fields. When the coordinates are changed, the triangle must be redrawn.
4. The color of the triangle changes depending on the selected widget. Widgets for color selection are grouped in frame. The minimum number of colors available for selection is 6, maximum is 16. The shape of the triangle should be covered with a solid fill of the same color.
5. When the user changes the size of a window, the widgets are moved to the relative new size.

This is what I should get as a result of the work:
